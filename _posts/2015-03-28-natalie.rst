One of my most vivid memories of your dad (probably because it happened over an 
over) were the 1-2, 1-2s! we'd beg him to do. Toss us in the pool over his head 
at the old condo community. 

Also, I had two pairs of his old work jeans, they took me through high school 
and college. The best naturally "distressed" jeans a girl could ask for. 

I think my mom still has some of his black jeans from later that she made bags 
out of. 

He also told me not to eat to many bananas or I'd "get the runs" and not to 
"carry so much money in your wallet or you might lose it" ...I hoarded my good 
report card money and carried it around around in my little kid wallet 'cause 
i thought it made me mature. It did not. It made me an oddly cash rich kid.
