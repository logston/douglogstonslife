I was thinking of Doug over the last couple of days and realized how 
little I knew him... the famously picky eater, "But what IS it?" and 
the cleaning obsession (vacuuming in the middle of a Christmas party 
was a new one to me) but he was consistent about one thing - he always 
lit up when Paul or Christopher entered the room. He loved his boys, 
he really LOVED his boys and it showed on his face. How lucky you both 
were to have that in your life. 

love,
Laurie
