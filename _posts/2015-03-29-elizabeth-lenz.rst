Although my interactions with Mr. Logston were short, I remember he was always 
very hospitable. When I visited Paul, his son, at their house in Hercules, 
Mr. Logston would be sitting in his recliner watching the tv near the kitchen. 
Usually, he would offer me a seat to join in on the fun. If I was in the kitchen
sitting at the island, he would get up and talk to me, offer me juice, water, 
milk, a snack, even an entire meal. When Paul and I would get ready to go, 
Mr. Logston would walk us out to say good-bye to Paul, chat for a little bit, 
and checked in on the cats that Paul threw off the car as he walked back into 
the house. He was a very loving father and made sure his sons' friends always 
felt welcome under their roof, which was always the case for me.
