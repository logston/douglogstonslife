I've known your dad for a number of years even before your mom and dad 
where married. What I didn't know about him was he need to clean. When 
my son Ricky was about 10 he used to stop at your Condo on the way back 
from school, when I picked him up I stayed a bit and talked to your mom 
until your dad came home. When he came in he immediately started to organize 
and clean the house, out came the vacuum cleaner and all the toys you guys were 
playing with had to be picked up and put away even if you were in the middle 
of playing everything had to be put away and he started vacuuming, once he 
stopped with the vacuum he started in on the kitchen even if Eileen had just 
cleaned it before he came home, I was dumbfounded on how he could work all day 
and then come home and do this, I asked Eileen if he was OCD she said yep and 
it was his way of winding down from the day, I thought if he needed more 
unwinding he could come to my place and un-wind a little more I had loads of 
therapy for him at my house. 

The other thing was how he loved and supported his boy's he loved to watch 
them in their numerous roles and always had an encouraging word for them after 
their performances in whatever play they were in. 

He was a kind and generous man that loved his entire family.
